there
was
no
possibility
of
taking
a
walk
that
day
we
had
been
wandering
indeed
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
but
since
dinner
mrs
reed
when
there
was
no
company
dined
early
the
cold
winter
wind
had
brought
with
it
clouds
so
sombre
and
a
rain
so
penetrating
that
further
out
door
exercise
was
now
out
of
the
question
i
was
glad
of
it
i
never
liked
long
walks
especially
on
chilly
afternoons
dreadful
to
me
was
the
coming
home
in
the
raw
twilight
with
nipped
fingers
and
toes
and
a
heart
saddened
by
the
chidings
of
bessie
the
nurse
and
humbled
by
the
consciousness
of
my
physical
inferiority
to
eliza
john
and
georgiana
reed
