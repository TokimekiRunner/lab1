Nowadays some countries are developed and have already achieved affluence. 
Some people think additional wealth would not make people happier.
I disagree this opinion to some extent.
The first reason why additional wealth can make people happier is because of the improvement in peoples life quality.
Country with affluence does not mean every peoples needs are met like better house and vehicles.
